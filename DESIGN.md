# IndustrialProtocolBridge Design Document

## System Components

1. **Modbus Client**: Simulates Modbus TCP communication with virtual devices
   - Handles register reading/writing
   - Manages connection retries and timeouts
   - Simulates multiple devices

2. **CAN Interface**: Simulates CAN bus communication
   - Supports standard and extended frame IDs
   - Handles message filtering
   - Simulates multiple devices

3. **Protocol Bridge**: Converts between protocols
   - Translates Modbus registers to CAN messages and vice versa
   - Implements message prioritization
   - Manages concurrent processing

4. **Message Queue** (C Extension): Priority-based message queue
   - Sorts messages by priority and timestamp
   - Efficient memory management
   - Exposed to Python via ctypes

5. **Demo Application**: CLI interface for testing
   - Simulates device activity
   - Displays message flow
   - Logs system activity

## Concurrency Model

The system uses asyncio for concurrency management:
- Each protocol client runs in its own task
- The protocol bridge coordinates message flow between clients
- The C extension provides thread-safe message prioritization

## Message Flow

1. Modbus client reads/writes register values
2. Messages are queued in the priority queue
3. Protocol bridge pulls messages from queue by priority
4. Messages are converted to target protocol format
5. Converted messages are sent to destination

## Error Handling Strategy

1. **Connection Issues**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
2. **Invalid Data**: Validation before processing, logging of errors
3. **Resource Exhaustion**: Queue size limits, timeout mechanisms
4. **Protocol Errors**: Error codes, status reporting

## Key Trade-offs

1. **Asyncio vs. Threading**: 
   - Using asyncio for simpler concurrency without thread safety issues
   - Better performance for I/O-bound operations

2. **Message Queuing**:
   - C-based priority queue for efficient message sorting
   - Trade-off between memory usage and sorting performance

3. **Simulation vs. Real Hardware**:
   - Mock implementations for testing without hardware
   - Design allows easy replacement with real device interfaces
